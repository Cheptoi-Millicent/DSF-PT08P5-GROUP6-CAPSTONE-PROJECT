# DSF-PT08P5-GROUP6-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
# Loan Default Prediction

## Overview
Loan default prediction is a crucial task for financial institutions to assess credit risk and minimize losses. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan, which is crucial for banks and financial institutions as it enables proactive risk management, reduces financial losses, and improves lending policies. The target audience includes banks and financial institutions, credit risk analysts, regulatory bodies, and fintech companies. The model can reduce bad debt and loan write-offs, improve lending policies by identifying high-risk applicants, and enhance customer profiling, leading to personalized lending solutions.

## Business Problem
In Kenya's evolving financial sector, both lenders and borrowers have considerable obstacles. Challenges encountered by lenders include elevated default rates, political and economic volatility, and corruption.

Borrowers face challenges include limited access to credit, high and variable interest rates, rigorous loan qualification criteria, and cultural and societal barriers, particularly impacting women. 

Loan default constitutes a substantial challenge within Kenya's financial sector, impacting the profitability and sustainability of lending institutions. The execution of governmental initiatives like the Hustler Fund underscores the necessity of addressing this issue. Launched in late 2022, the Hustler Fund aimed to provide accessible credit to Kenyan residents, offering loans at an annual interest rate of 8%. As of August 2023, more than 29% of the outstanding loan portfolio was classified as at-risk, with nearly 3 billion shillings in defaults, indicating a default rate nearly twice that of commercial banks.


## Data Sources
The dataset comprises multiple sources:
- **Application Data:** Demographics, employment details, and loan purpose.
- **Contract Data:** Loan amount, tenure, and type.
- **CRB Data:** Credit scores and risk grades.
- **Transaction Data:** Bank account balances, overdraft limits, and bounced cheques.
- **Repayment Data:** Loan repayment behavior, outstanding amounts, and due payments.

## Features Used
- **Demographics:** Age, marital status, employment status, dependents.
- **Loan Information:** Loan amount, tenure, purpose, type.
- **Credit History:** CRB score, past loan repayment behavior.
- **Bank Transactions:** Average balance, Monthly_Income, bounced cheques.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Merging multiple datasets, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding data distributions and correlations.
3. **Model Selection** – Using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
4. **Model Training & Tuning** – Hyperparameter optimization for best performance.
5. **Evaluation** – Measuring accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
6. **Deployment** – Developing a web app for real-time predictions using Flask/FastAPI.
